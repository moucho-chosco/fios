# Fios Website

This repository contains the source code for the Fios website (https://fios.netlify.app), a Hugo-based project.

## Project Structure

- **`config.toml`**: Main Hugo configuration file. It defines site-wide settings, languages, menus, and taxonomies.
- **`content/`**: Contains the website's content in Markdown format.
    - Content is organized into subdirectories, often corresponding to website sections.
    - The site supports two languages:
        - Galician (ILG, default): Files typically end with `.md`.
        - AGAL: Files typically end with `.agal.md`.
- **`layouts/`**: Holds the Hugo templates (HTML) that define the website's structure and appearance.
    - `_default/`: Contains default templates for different content types (lists, single pages).
    - `partials/`: Contains reusable template snippets (e.g., header, sidebar).
    - `section/`: Contains templates specific to certain website sections.
- **`static/`**: Stores static assets like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
    - `biblioteca/`: Contains images and banners related to the "Biblioteca" section.
    - `css/`: Contains stylesheets for the website.
    - `espazos/`: Contains assets for the "Espazos" section.
    - `images/`: Contains general images, logos, and UI elements.
    - `organizacions/`: Contains images and logos for various organizations.
    - `scripts/`: Contains JavaScript files.
- **`public/`** (or `output-folder/`): This directory is typically generated by Hugo and contains the built website. It's often included in `.gitignore`. *(Developer Note: Based on the `ls` output, both `public/` and `output-folder/` exist. It might be good to clarify which one is the actual Hugo output and ensure the other is gitignored or removed if redundant).*

## Website Sections

The website is organized into several main sections, as defined in `config.toml`:

- Principal
- Biblioteca (Library)
- Organización / Organizaçom (Organization)
- Espazos / Espaços (Spaces)
- Podcast
- Recursos (Resources)

*(Note: Some sections like Calendario/Calendário (Calendar) and Convocatorias/Convocatórias (Calls/Events) are commented out in the `config.toml` menu configuration, so they might not be currently active on the live site).*

## Building and Running Locally

To build and run this website locally using Hugo:

1.  **Install Hugo:** Follow the instructions on the [official Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
3.  **Run the Hugo server:**
    ```bash
    hugo server
    ```
    This will usually make the site available at `http://localhost:1313/`. The site will automatically rebuild when you make changes to the content or templates.

4.  **Build the website:**
    ```bash
    hugo
    ```
    This command will generate the static website files into the `public/` directory (or the directory specified in the `publishDir` setting in `config.toml`).
